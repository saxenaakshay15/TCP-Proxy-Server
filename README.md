# TCP Proxy Server

## Description

The TCP Proxy Server is a C++ utility that acts as an intermediary, forwarding TCP connections from external clients to a designated remote server. The server supports several features, including:

- Limiting the number of client connections to the server.
- Load balancing client connections between multiple server instances.
- IP or connection time-based filtering and access control mechanisms.
- Inspecting, logging, filtering, or modifying data flowing between clients and the server.

This project includes a simple implementation of the TCP Proxy Server and provides additional Python scripts for verifying its functionality.

## Features

- **Client-to-Server Proxying:** Forwards client connections to a specified remote server.
- **Data Forwarding:** Handles upstream (server-to-client) and downstream (client-to-server) data flow.
- **Connection Handling:** Manages client sessions and connections with asynchronous operations.

## Compatibility

The project is compatible with the following:

- **Compilers:** Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Compiler (MSVC) on Windows.

## Files Included

- `proxy_server.cpp`: The main implementation of the TCP Proxy Server.
- `server.py`: A simple Python script to act as the remote server for testing.
- `client.py`: A simple Python script to act as the client for testing.
- `Makefile`: Build configuration for compiling the TCP Proxy Server using MSVC on Windows.

## Build Instructions

1. **Open a Command Prompt** with MSVC environment variables set (e.g., "Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio").

2. **Navigate to the Directory** containing the `Makefile` and `proxy_server.cpp`.

3. **Build the Project** by running:

   ```bash
   nmake
   ```

   This will produce the `proxy_server.exe` executable.

## Running the Server and Client

### Remote Server

1. Save `server.py` to your preferred directory.
2. Run the server script with Python:

   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

   The server will listen on port 12345.

### TCP Proxy Server

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `proxy_server.exe`.
2. Run the TCP Proxy Server with the following command:

   ```bash
   proxy_server.exe 127.0.0.1 8080 127.0.0.1 12345
   ```

   - `127.0.0.1` (local IP) and `8080` (local port) for the proxy.
   - `127.0.0.1` (remote IP) and `12345` (remote port) for the remote server.

### Client

1. Save `client.py` to your preferred directory.
2. Run the client script with Python:

   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

   The client will send a message to the proxy server, which will forward it to the remote server and echo the response back.

## Verification

To verify that the TCP Proxy Server works correctly:

1. **Run the Remote Server** to listen for incoming connections.
2. **Start the TCP Proxy Server** to forward connections from clients to the remote server.
3. **Run the Client Script** to send a test message through the proxy.

You should see the following:

- The proxy server logs connections and data forwarding.
- The remote server displays the data received from the client.
- The client script displays the echoed response from the server.

## Notes

- Ensure that the ports specified are open and not in use by other applications.
- The provided Python scripts (`server.py` and `client.py`) are for testing purposes and may be modified to fit different scenarios.
